# TODO

- [ ] Get an idea regarding the daily commit summary Discord message's format

### Airtable integration

- [ ] Send Discord webhook alerts to the #help-wanted channel (in-case of issues) and to the project's individual channel (in-case of daily summary of commits)
- [ ] Fetch the data of the project's repository instead of `0xMukesh/testing`
- [ ] Use the project's name in the embed's title instead of repository's name
